UnHighlight
===========

Firefox extension to strip ?highlight=... from URLs.
This makes it nicer to search the Python docs and CMake docs, among other things.

This extension is currently v0.2 and under-tested. It is likely stable, but some more usage is required before it can be released as v1.0.
